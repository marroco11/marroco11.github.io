    Re: Eileen Dover university application 
</h1>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

<p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part 
    of your <abbr title = " Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. <!--Wrapping PhD with acronym/abbreviation-->
    I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>

<h2> <!--Marking as the header 2 element-->
    Starting dates
</h2>

<p>
    We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
    could start at the beginning of a semester, the start date for each one are as follows:
</p>


<ul> <!--Semester start dates as Unordered lists-->
    <li>First semester:  <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
    <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
    <li>Third semester:  <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date would you prefer. <br/><br/>

    You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank" title="important uni dates">important university dates</a> on our website. <!--Hyperlink tag for the attached website-->

<h2>Subjects of study</h2> <!--Marking as the header 2 element-->


<p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall
    somehwere in the realm of science and techbology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
    by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>


<ol type = "1"> <!--Study subjects as Ordered lists, type 1 for numbered lists-->
    <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li> <!--Subscript element for the chemical formula-->
    <li> Measuring the effect on performance on funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) when the
        audience size exponentially increases (effect 3 X 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 X 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li> <!--Superscript element to indicate a power of a number-->
    <li><abbr title = " Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title = " Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li> <!--Wrapping "HTML" & "CSS" with acronym/abbreviation-->
</ol>


<p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take,
    required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>

<h2>
    Exotic dance moves
</h2>

<p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances.
    To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>

<dl> <!--Exotic dances as Description lists-->
    <dt>
        Polynesian chicken dance
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
        A little known but <em>very</em> influential dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, <!--Wrapping "BC" with acronym/abbreviation-->
        a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
    </dt>

    <dd>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students to say that he thought this dance inspired
        modern style such as Twerking.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Arctic robot dance
    </dt>

    <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
        because they were really cold.
