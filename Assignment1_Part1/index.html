<p>Dear Eileen,<br/><br/>

    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br/>
    of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

</p>

<h4>
    Starting dates
</h4>

<p>
    We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br/>
    could start at the beginning of a semester, the start date for each one are as follows:<br/>

    <u1>
        <li>Firstsemester: 9 September 2016</li>

    </u1> <br/>


    Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date would you prefer. <br/>

<h4>
    Subjects of study
</h4>

<p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall
    somehwere in the realm of science and techbology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
    by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>

    <ol type = "1">
        <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li> Measuring the effect on performance on funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) when the<br/>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect 3 X 10 <sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 X 10 <sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>


    </ol>
